# BofA-Code-to-Connect-2022

Bank of America Code to Connect 2022 is a coding challenge that is organized by Bank of America to connect with young, aspiring undergraduates. I was a shortlisted participant under the _Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) Technology_ division. 

In this challenge, I developed a full-stack Java project for a bond portfolio tracker across multiple trading desks, with real-time display of market and trade event data in the user interface. Specifically, I have implemented functions for real-time calculation of cash and bond portfolio values, and generated reports in .csv format for a total of 10,000 timestamps in 6 different trading desks
